		<h3>Engineering Consultancy</h3>
			<p>
				Flucomp was founded by Dr. Diana Matonis, a leader in her industry for more than 25 years. Our engineering consultancy
				practice includes our capabilities in plant assessments through the use of process engineering and design, to provide 
				insights of current efficiency and product yield leading to their improvements through new plant technology and startups.
			</p>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>
				We improved the quality, consistency and yield of a product for a startup biofuels company that used a new integrated
				pyrolytic process for obtaining saturated and unsaturated alkyl esters from biomass; we improved their process to the point
				where they were able to produce a consistent biodiesel-grade product.
			</p>
			<h3>Our Process</h3>
			<p>
				In cultivating a robust assessment, evaluation and technology planning, we utilize our skills and experience and have 
				identified and typically use three key phases as a starting point.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Iterative Analysis
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li><em>SIPOC</em> (Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs and Customer) oriented interviews</li>
						<li>Models made based on the results of these interviews</li>
						<li>Modeled processes are reviewed with the process owners and/or stakeholders</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Model Based Systems Engineering for Value (Value Based)
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Translate business practice reality into critical design models and requirement specifications.</li>
						<li>Accurately capture, analyze and verify design integrity before problems become embedded in the system</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Implementation
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>Improvements grounded in reality, making them efficient and effective.</li>
						<li>Requirements create an accurate picture of business practice needs.</li>
						<li>Understanding the client's business practices results in a more focused capability development and improvement</li>
						<li>Results are directly traceable to the implemented solutions</li>
					</ul>
